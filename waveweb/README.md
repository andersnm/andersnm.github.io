# Waveweb

https://andersnm.github.io/waveweb

Very WIP features:

- Record audio from microphone or external sound card
- Cut/paste/crop/zoom/undo/redo
- Working buffer and undo/redo via Indexeddb
- Homegrown reactive UI framework using Tailwind for styles

There is no export, so this is not useful yet.

TODO:

- Become wavetable in greater tracker/sequencer/DAW project :-)
